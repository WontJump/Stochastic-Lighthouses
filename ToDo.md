**TODO** 

- code in the adjacency matrices for stars 
- be able to vary spoke size 
- find a way to find the variance of the random walk 
- consider how quickly fall 

- trying to find ways to analyse time series data 
- sadly this isn't stationary data 


- from just playin around I've noticed that the star has a very small max dif but also its min path distance between any two points is only 2 . that would suggest ...
